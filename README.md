# Anime styled image generation based on text input




## Introduction
In this project, we will create a simple Streamlit app that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to generate images from text. We will be replicating an existing API that can generate images based on text input.

## Requirements
Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Streamlit (to create the web app)
- requests (to send HTTP requests to the API)
- Pillow (to manipulate the images generated by the API)
- Replicate API key (to access the API)


## Create your virtual env :
Create your new environment conda using : 

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

run the streamlit app using  :

```streamlit run main.py```
